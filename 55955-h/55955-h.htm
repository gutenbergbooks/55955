<h2>Ports of Entry</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Scarcely</span> any other three words form a phrase freighted with
meaning so vital to our national life. Here is the convergence
of streams of humanity flowing from the ends of
the world. Through these gateways more than 33,000,000
aliens have come to our shores. Much that they have brought has
been antagonistic to the spirit and purpose of our institutions, but
their great contribution has been the world's wealth of physical
strength, intellectual power, spiritual vigor, religious fervor and
the incarnation of the yearning passion of the soul for liberty and
life. It is our duty to recognize the value of their offering in terms
of manhood and womanhood and not merely in terms of finance
and business, and to so discharge the responsibility involved in
opening our gates, as to help them to properly appreciate their
privilege and opportunity, and to make possible the realization of
their ideals.</p>

<p>Dr. Steiner says, "It is a big task, the biggest and most difficult
and yet most rewarding task the Church has to face."</p>


<p class="center bold in0 p2t">The Immigrant's Welcome</p>

<p>The Federal authorities endeavor to receive the immigrant with
a genuinely humane welcome. Some of our ports have not buildings
properly equipped for receiving and examining immigrants
and caring for the detained. Occasionally there are rumors of
instances of harsh treatment on the part of the Government. For
some of these there is doubtless occasion, but one who has the
opportunity to see the Ports of Entry service in all its phases
through a series of months, will be convinced that honesty, carefulness
and kindness characterize the method and manner of the
Government officials and employees, and that nowhere else is the
immigrant received more humanely and treated more kindly and
courteously than at our Ports of Entry.</p>

<p>Dr. Frederic C. Howe, Commissioner of Immigration at the
Port of New York, recently said, "Ellis Island is public property
and those of us who are over there are public servants. We have
made provisions at Ellis Island so that every man, woman or child
in the United States can participate in its administration. We did
that through inviting suggestions, criticisms, complaints. We believe
the best curative of disease is sunlight, and the sunlight that
we are aiming to turn on Ellis Island is the sunlight of as many
human eyes as will turn themselves on that station with their suggestions
or complaints. I invite you to come to Ellis Island, to
see the station and to examine it, to meet your friends and to aid the
six hundred men over there in the Government employ in making
Ellis Island a place we all love."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>


<p class="center bold in0 p2t">Our Missionaries</p>

<p>No part of the immigrant welcome service is more important
than that which is done by the missionaries. Their purpose is primarily
to carry the gospel story of salvation and good cheer. "Behold,
I bring you glad tidings of great joy" is the message of the
Ports of Entry missionary. This work, however, combines regard
for spiritual life and material welfare. It must be humanitarian
and philanthropic service of a very practical sort. It is the cup of
water "In His name" given with the personal touch of one of His
disciples.</p>

<p>On page 18 will be found a list of other Societies and Organizations
engaged in this immigrant welcome service.</p>


<p class="center bold in0 p2t">The Home Missions Council<br />
and<br />
Council of Women for Home Missions</p>

<p>At the annual meeting, January 12, 1915, the Committee on
Immigrant Work reported&mdash;"We are confirmed by Dr. Selden's
brief study and by all that we have seen and heard during the year
in the opinion expressed in our last report, as follows:</p>

<p>"If the Council desires to do the far-visioned thing, based on
the broad and stable principles which should govern the King's
business, let it lay hands upon the strongest available man and put
him at the task of inquiry, of leadership, of unification, of inspiration,
beginning at the <b>port of entry</b> and gradually extending his
knowledge and influence until he stands at the center of the whole
field of our service in alien tongues."</p>

<p>"We do not, however, venture at this time to suggest a program
so elaborate nor a task so comprehensive for the Council's representative.
We review in effect our recommendation of last year
that the Council proceed conservatively and that effort for
the coming year be limited in the main to the <i>ports of entry</i>. The
relatively small volume of immigration now coming in, while
making less immediate demands upon us, affords peculiar advantages
for study of the problems involved, for conference with
Government officials, and for development, readjustment and organization
of the missionary force. At the end of a year of inquiry
and effort along these lines, having all the time in view the larger
field of our work across the country, your Committee hopes to be
able to report substantial progress and to suggest how further to
profit by the ground gained in the inquiries of last year and the
year to come."</p>

<p>"Your Committee is glad to be able to announce that the Council
of Women for Home Missions has been increasingly interested
in the matter under discussion and has recommended to its constituent
bodies that they assume one-third of the expense of any plan
adopted for the coming year."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>At this meeting the following recommendation of the Business
Committee was adopted, "That the Council, in cooperation with the
Council of Women for Home Missions, ask the Rev. Joseph E.
Perry, Ph.D., to act as representative of the two Councils at ports
of entry, for the year beginning January 15, 1915."</p>

<p>The task of directing the work of the representative of the two
Councils at the Ports of Entry was given to a "Committee of Six"
composed of three persons chosen from the "Immigrant Work
Committee" of the Home Missions Council, and three from the
"Committee of Missionary Interests Among the Immigrants" of
the Council of Women.</p>

<p>In accordance with the policy and program proposed by the
"Committee of Six" the time of the secretary was spent mainly in
touch with the missionary work and workers at the Ports of Entry
in Philadelphia, Boston and Ellis Island. Conferences were held
with representatives of the Federal Government and agents and
workers of various societies working with the Immigrant, including
the Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners at the Ports mentioned,
Mr. Green of the Federal Information Bureau, representatives
of the Y. M. C. A., and Y. W. C. A. City and International
Committees, the W. C. T. U., the Committee for Immigrants of
America, the North American Civic League, the Travelers' Aid,
the Immigrant Guide and Transfer Agency, and with missionaries
working at these Ports.</p>

<p>These interviews and conferences revealed:</p>

<p>1. The fact that organization and cooperation in this work is
almost universally regarded as essential to the permanent establishment
of any large service for the Immigrant, and especially is this
true of the missionary work. It is quite generally regarded that
lack of system is a great hindrance to the comprehensive effectiveness
of this very important phase of the service rendered for the
arriving Immigrant.</p>

<p>2. All other Societies and Agencies have rather definitely systematized
their work. This fact appeals to the Government officials
and enables these Societies to have recognition and consideration
by Federal and Municipal authorities and other agencies interested
in the formation of any comprehensive scheme for the protection of
the Immigrant.</p>

<p>3. In every Port the officials bear fine testimony to the very
useful service rendered by the Christian missionaries. But even so
their estimate is based on the <b>social</b> and <b>humanitarian</b> side of the
work, and not on the <b>spiritual</b> phase of their service.</p>

<p>4. If the Christian missionaries and the religious workers were
withdrawn from this service at the Ports of Entry, it would be like
withdrawing the sun from the heavens.</p>

<p>The activities involved in this service are as varied as the duties
of a missionary in any other field of work. They must clothe the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
naked, visit the sick, comfort the sorrowing, cheer the despondent,
give courage to the hesitating, frightened stranger, care for the
dying, and sometimes minister at the burial service. They read
to the illiterate, write letters and supply papers and literature.
Indeed, they must be voice, ears, hands and feet; even heart and
soul to hundreds and thousands of these children from the old
world, now babes in a new life.</p>

<p>The true spirit of harmony, brotherly kindness, and heart sympathy
filled with the spirit of power of Christian love, characterizes
their work. Nothing else could fulfil its mission. It is also very
evident that the full potential value of this work has not yet been
actualized. This part of the missionary service of the Christian
Church may be made a much more forceful and fruitful agency
in the work of the Kingdom. It ought to be a source and center of
greater power in the <b>Home missionary</b> work of our entire country,
and can be made an agency of power in our <b>Foreign missionary</b>
work. To realize the full measure of the possible power and usefulness
of this branch of missionary work, is the central purpose of
our task. To accomplish this purpose it was evident that our missionary
work should be organized in some comprehensive and definite
scheme that would unite practically all the religious forces and
represent to the immigrant the heart and spirit of American Christian
sentiment, and that would combine in a practical way the work
of all Ports of Entry, and also vitally relate this work to all immigrant
work inland, aiding and being supplemented by such work.
In this way also our missionary work could be related readily to
all civic and philanthropic immigrant work in any city or community.
The adoption of such plan, because of its being interdenominational
in principle and having unselfish ideals, and being
practical and comprehensive in its working, would commend itself
to the Federal, Civic and Municipal Government authorities. It
will commend itself also to the religious communities and societies
for the same reasons, and also because of a possible lessening of
expense, and of securing larger and more permanent results for the
effort and money expended.</p>

<p>A plan of organization was presented by the secretary to the
Committee of Six, which was adopted by them and referred to the
missionaries at Ellis Island for their consideration. This proposition
provided for the appointment of certain committees on the
different departments of the missionary work, and for conferences
of workers and for relating the work to that of other Ports of Entry,
and for uniting the port missionary work to the missionary work
inland.</p>

<h2>Ellis Island</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> center of the year's work has been Ellis Island, the great
home and foreign mission field, in area covering a few acres,
in influence compassing the entire world. Any one with
ability to "sense" a condition standing at Ellis Island feels
himself to be not at the "hub of the universe," but at the heart of
the world, through which are circulating the life currents of the
old world and the new. More than one-half of those coming to our
shores enter by this gateway. Here is the beginning of the preparation
of this great mass of humanity for the process of assimilation
into the American spirit and life.</p>

<p>The missionaries at Ellis Island adopted the plan of organization
approved by the Committee of Six, and appointed the committees
provided for. The operation of this plan has been very satisfactory
considering all that is involved. The Committees are organized and
reports from some of them are given in the following pages.</p>

<p>There are now twenty-five missionaries and workers representing
the Boards and Societies federated with the two Councils, and
other Societies cooperating in the work of federating the religious
forces in this branch of missionary service. The field of service
and the activities of the missionaries at Ellis Island is typical of
all Ports of Entry missionary work.</p>

<p>The field of this ministry is:</p>

<p>(a) The railroad rooms. Here quick work must be done. It is
just touch and go. The missionaries of our Societies, the American
Tract Society, the New York Bible Society, the Y. M. C. A., Y. W.
C. A., W. C. T. U., and kindred agencies do most excellent service.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>(b) Among the detained Immigrants. This is a field of varied
service and is perhaps the place of greatest opportunity for our missionaries
and is specifically their field.</p>

<p>(c) The hospital. This is a very important part of the work
for, and with, those who are detained. Of course, there is need of
temporal relief and comforts, but here especially there are times
when no one can minister except one who brings spiritual comfort
and the cheer of the love of God.</p>


<p class="center bold in0 p2t">Missionary Activities</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> missionaries at our Ports meet and aid representatives
of the following nationalities, viz.: English, Irish, Scotch,
Welsh, French, Swiss, German, Dutch, Belgian, Hebrews of
various nations, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Italian,
Spanish, Portuguese, Austrian, Greek, Turkish, Armenian,
Bulgarian, Servian, Roumanian, Albanian, Hungarian, Bohemian,
Croatian, Slovenian, Ruthenian, Lithuanian, Russian, Polish, Mexican,
Cuban, and other West Indian, Panamanian, Venezuelan,
Columbian, Argentinian, Australian, Maltese, West African, Egyptian,
Syrian, Persian, Hindu, Chaldean, Chinese, Japanese, and
Korean,&mdash;in all, 52.</p>

<p>Visitors to Ellis Island often ask, "Just what do the missionaries
do?" The Rev. Eliot White, Port Chaplain of the Protestant
Episcopal City Mission Society, gives the following answer to this
query:</p>

<p>We meet those newly coming from the ocean steamers to Ellis
Island, and less frequently, second-cabin passengers at the docks.
We aid them through the Immigration Station in many ways, with
tickets, trunks and hand baggage, with food, sometimes getting
milk heated for a baby, or "minding" little children while parents
look for their trunks; telegraph or telephone to relatives or friends,
give information of many sorts, expediting the progress through
the day's ordeals of those fortunate enough to pass without
detention.</p>

<p>As for those who are detained and designated for "special
inquiry," our duties in their behalf are more complicated and often
difficult and sad. Appeals must be written in many cases. Where
the exclusion is mandatory, we have special opportunity for the
specifically pastoral and consolatory offices in presence of bitter
disappointment and sometimes heart-broken sorrow. Many are the
physical needs also, of the detained, and those to be deported;
indeed, the only limitation on service of this sort is the worker's
time and strength. There is clothing to supply for those sometimes
wretchedly clad, and even barefooted on the cold stone floors,
and there are errands to run for many a humble requirement. Then
there is the often sad office of messenger between the sick in the
immigrant hospital and their relatives detained on the main island,
and sometimes a burial to conduct when the entrance to the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
of hope has been shadowed by some dear one's death. For some
time after they have left Ellis Island, we maintain a "follow-up"
correspondence with many whom we meet.</p>

<p class="in0">I. <span class="smcap">Organization</span>:</p>

<p>At a meeting held on June 29, 1915, the following resolutions
were adopted: (1) The general distribution in the Railroad rooms
should be left to the New York Bible Society and the American
Tract Society, except in cases where missionaries are especially
interested. (2) The present methods of distribution in hospitals
and detention rooms are approved. (3) The literature distributed
in general should be interdenominational and not of a proselyting
nature. (4) The New York Bible Society and the American Tract
Society are requested to supply missionaries with literature for
distribution in hospitals and detention rooms. (5) The Home
Missions Council is requested to supply special tracts for young
men and young women with advice for immigrants in general.
(6) The Home Missions Council is requested to supply the
detained immigrants with daily papers, periodicals and if possible
with library books.</p>

<p class="in0">II. <span class="smcap">The Duty of the Committee</span>:</p>

<p>(1) To see that the literature distributed is suitable. (2) If
special kind of literature is needed to outline its character. (3) To

needed literature. (4) To see that the literature distributed is
evangelical and undenominational.</p>

<p class="in0">III. <span class="smcap">Literature is Distributed</span>:</p>

<p>(1) In the Railroad Rooms. (2) In the Detention Rooms,

<p class="center bold in0 p2t">The Clothing of the Immigrants<br />
at Ellis Island, N. Y.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">One</span> of the most important items in the work of the missionaries
at Ellis Island is the work of providing suitable
clothing and shoes for the many aliens detained at the
Island. Only by strict adherence to certain principles can
the work be a real success. The first of these principles is: Never
give an alien that which is beneath his dignity to wear or to use.
This may sound strange, but is nevertheless very important. All
the aliens, except stowaways and warrant cases, bring their wearing
apparel with them. Stowaways are as a rule not very particular.
Warrant cases, since they have been in this country and
know how to dress, are quite particular. The average alien will
not look with favor upon any person who offers him a garment
which is worn out, or which he would be ashamed to wear
at home. There are other difficulties. Some of the aliens will not
accept for instance an old lady's overcoat which was worn 20 years
ago. Of such we receive quite an overwhelming number. Others
cling strongly to their home fashions and will only accept such
things as in some manner correspond to their accustomed styles.
The second principle is: to give only to the really needy. Caution
is necessary. Some immigrants are greedy, they accept everything
which is offered, put it into their hampers, and keep on wearing
their old worn-out duds in the hope of receiving still more gifts.
<i>Another</i> principle is to try and <i>fit</i> the alien as well as possible. If
the coat or shoes fit him, he will wear them with pleasure and will
not feel ridiculous among his fellows.</p>

<p><i>Another</i> principle is to study the social training and tastes of
the immigrants and if they need clothes give such things as will
make their appearance more respectable. One of the purposes of
the clothes department is: to have the alien appear before the
Board of Special Inquiry as neat and respectable looking as possible,
so that he may be judged as he would look under ordinary
circumstances, not as he arrives after a lengthy trip in the steerage.
<i>Another</i> principle is: not to overlap. Where there is a number of
missionaries there is always the danger of overlapping in the distribution
of gifts.</p>

<p>At Ellis Island a clothes room of moderate proportions is in
use. It is divided into sections, and clothes are kept separately
for men, women, and children. Shoes and other things have their
proper places. A great deal of valuable time is consumed in sorting
out the things which are utterly unfit to give away. We cannot
insist too strongly upon the necessity of not sending things
which are useless, worn out, or ridiculous. The average alien has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
a great deal more knowledge and taste than he is credited with by
the donors in various churches. Shoes and clothes ought to be at
least in good repair. It would be far better to send fewer and
better things, than to send great boxes of indifferent material.</p>

<p><i>The greatest needs.</i> Underwear, suitable to the season of year,
shoes of large proportions, men's overcoats, socks and stockings
for all, infants' outfits for the newly born, and children's clothes are
always welcome and appreciated. Also a lot of other things seldom
received, garters, suspenders, toilet articles, such as combs,
finecombs, shaving mugs, brushes, etc. All these things are needed
every day. The most essential principle of all this work, however,
is for the missionary to put heart into it, and not to let the recipient
feel that the work is done perfunctorily or with aversion. The
missionary sometimes must even show how to make use of the gift
and must see to it that the clothes are actually worn, etc. It is a
blessed work if properly done.</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p2t">Missionary Work in the Immigrant Hospital,<br />
Ellis Island</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> daily visits of the missionaries in the hospital wards on
Ellis Island have proved a great blessing and a help to the
immigrants. We are also in various ways helpful to the
doctors and nurses in their attentions to the patients, and
very often act as an interpreter. The missionaries are particularly
responsible for those people in whose languages they are able to
converse. They visit these daily, if possible or advisable, but they
also pay attention by little gifts and sympathy to the other patients
in the ward, and by doing so become friends to everybody. Our
first object in visiting new arrivals is to let them know that the
relatives who traveled with them on the same ship are waiting
for them in the large Immigration Detention Rooms and will not
leave before the sick one is discharged from the hospital. This is
always welcome news, for most all the poor, helpless patients seem
to be under the impression that their friends have left them when
separated from them by the doctors. After a little explanation
and comforting words, we leave (if advisable) some good literature
with them and promise soon to call again and bring greetings
from their loved ones. As they see us talking to other patients,
they find confidence and take courage among the strangers, and
wait anxiously our return. We visit all the wards in the hospital
except the contagious hospital, where the missionaries are allowed
only by special permission from the Superintendent or doctors.
The missionaries are called upon to supply the patients with the
most necessary articles of clothing to those discharged from the
hospital, and also to supply many children and adults with shoes
and stockings when under treatment for trachoma or any other
disease, which does not confine the patients to the bed. They furnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
the outfit for new-born infants for which the mothers had no
chance to provide, or were too poor to do so. We bring tags, picture
books, dolls and other little gifts to the sick and lonesome
children. To the adults we carry newspapers and magazines in different
languages, books, gospels and tracts. On Christmas we
place trees in the different wards and give appropriate presents to
all the patients. The missionaries communicate with the relatives
or friends of the sick aliens. In case of death they assist in every
way possible. Pastors often officiate at the funeral services.</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p2t">Committee on Appeals and Petitions</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">When</span> a case is excluded at Ellis Island an appeal is
allowed to the Secretary of Labor in Washington, as a
higher "court," except when the exclusion is because of
certain contagious disease, mental inferiority and the
like.</p>

<p>The missionaries at Ellis Island not infrequently write the
appeals, endeavoring to bring out points in the cases which
strengthen the appellants' cause.</p>

<p>They also make petitions for hospital treatment for such unappealable
cases as sufferers from trachoma, hookworm, etc. This
treatment, if allowed by the Secretary of Labor, is at the expense
of the aliens' relatives. If the afflicted person is cured, he or she
is, if otherwise eligible to land, admitted to the country.</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="smcap">Eliot White</span>,&#8195;&#8195;<br />
For the Committee.</p>

<p>In the complete working out of this plan the proper method
will be for any missionary wishing to file an appeal, to confer with
this Committee, and especially so before making an appeal to the
Secretary of Labor in Washington. In some instances at least,
this will be a protection for the missionary against unwise petitions
of friends and relatives.</p>


<p class="center bold in0 p2t">Follow-up Committee</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">This</span> Committee is to be the connecting link between the
Ports of Entry and the inland work. The missionaries fill
out blanks, giving the name and destination of the arriving
immigrant. These blanks are given to the Follow-up Committee
and duplicates with a letter are forwarded to a pastor or
worker in the place of the immigrant's destination with a request
that the family be visited, and a reply sent on the postal card
enclosed with the letter. In this short period 198 names
have been forwarded. It is, however, too soon to measure the
value of this work.</p>

For the Committee.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>The effectiveness of the work of this Committee necessitates
having a list of pastors and workers in the entire country. This
will be greatly simplified by the appointment of local interdenominational
committees such as have been appointed in several towns
and cities. It can be made a most important force in correlating
the work of the different Ports of Entry, and strengthening our
inland missionary work.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Commissioner</span> Howe having given his consent to the
holding of Religious Services, five of these were conducted

the missionaries representing the Congregational, Episcopal,
Lutheran, Methodist, and Presbyterian Churches.</p>

<p>At present the best available hour on Sundays (2.30 to 3.30
p.m.) is occupied usually by a concert, so that the services have
been somewhat interfered with. It is hoped, however, soon to meet
this difficulty.</p>

<h2>Boston Port of Entry</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Boston</span> is the headquarters for the District No. 2, including
Portland, Maine, Providence, R. I., New Bedford and Fall
River. The immigrant station in Boston is not at all adequate
to the needs.</p>

<p>The Commissioner General of Immigration in his report of 1912
quotes from the report of the Commissioner of Immigration at
Boston for 1912 as follows: "We are continuing to make the best
of the very limited quarters which are occupied as an immigration
station in Boston. An effort is made, however, to counterbalance the
inadequate conditions by insistence upon the highest standard of care
and cleanliness. The conditions at Portland and New Bedford are
probably as good as can be expected under the existing circumstances.
There is almost a total lack of proper inspection facilities at the
growing port of Providence."</p>

<p>In some respects the ports of Boston and Ellis Island are quite
closely related. The Massachusetts Immigration Commission found
that the conditions at the boats from Boston to New York were very
bad indeed. These have been remedied to some extent. This, however,
is a very important matter and should have further consideration.</p>

<p>During the past ten years the yearly average number of immigrants
arriving in Massachusetts has been 73,383.</p>

<p>Seventeen missionary societies and other organizations have
eighteen to twenty workers at this port.</p>

<p>An Immigrant Girls' Home is maintained in East Boston by the
Methodist Episcopal Church. This building is well equipped and
adequately furnished for its purpose. There are accommodations for
lodging about forty-five women and thirty to forty men and a few
rooms are provided for families. The Home is located near the wharf
of the Cunard Line.</p>

<p>Mrs. A. C. Clark, the superintendent, has been engaged in this
work at the Boston port for twenty-seven years. She and Miss
Bridgman of the Y. W. C. A., and Miss Brown of the Woman's
Baptist Home Mission Society, have been working several years at
this port and are highly commended by the authorities for their excellent
service.</p>

<p>The Y. M. C. A. has been doing in Boston work corresponding
to that of the Travelers' Aid Society. Representatives of the Y. M.
C. A. under the direction of Dr. Tupper are also working at this
port.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>Excellent work is being done here also by the representatives of
other societies. Here as elsewhere the work, however, is almost
wholly unrelated to the conditions that obtain in New England, and
indeed in the immediate vicinity of the entry stations. The workers
are now considering a plan for organizing their work similar to that
adopted by the missionaries at Ellis Island. It seems now to be a very
opportune time to effect a good organization for the port work in
New England.</p>

<p>The entire field of this district presents some problems that can,
without doubt, be finally solved and the proper solution of which
would result in very large gain in the work among the immigrants in
the entire New England region.</p>

<h2>Philadelphia Port of Entry</h2>
</div>

<p class="center bold in0 p2t"><span class="smcap">Immigration Station</span></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">There</span> are two stations for landing the immigrants, one at the
foot of Washington Street; the other at the foot of Vine Street.
Immigrants are examined at these two stations. Those who
are detained for any reason are taken by boat to Gloucester
City where the new station has been built. In Gloucester they have a
very well-equipped building with offices for administration, sleeping
rooms for detained immigrants, dining room and small rooms for
special hospital cases. Until the new hospital is built, most of the
hospital patients are sent to different hospitals in the city. There is
also here a pier containing three acres on which is to be built a Receiving
Station to allow all immigrants to be examined at Gloucester.
The equipment of the building at Gloucester in every particular is
modern and of the very best. The dining room especially, is fitted
up in the very best approved style; it is large enough to allow two
hundred to eat at one time. The walls and floor are cement; the
tables and seats are metal, so that the entire room can be washed out
with hose, as the floor slopes toward a drain in which is carried off all
the water.</p>


<p class="center bold in0 p2t">Missionaries and Workers</p>

<p>Twenty different societies are represented at this port by missionaries
or agents. Fourteen of these may be called strictly religious
societies. The work is carried on here about the same as at Boston
and Ellis Island. There is no definite plan for following up the work
after the immigrants leave Philadelphia. Those who remain in
Philadelphia are visited as far as possible and their addresses are
given to the workers of the nearest church or mission. The Episcopal
and Lutheran workers usually send the names and addresses of those
immigrants who are connected with their churches to the pastors in
the towns or cities to which these immigrants are going.</p>

<p>The Lutheran Church has three representatives. They work together
in supplementing the work of each other.</p>

<p>Under the direction of Mr. Demberg, the Young Men's Christian
Association Immigration Bureau conducts the work at this station
in the same manner as at other ports. Similar conditions obtain here
as at the other ports, namely, that the missionaries are doing a most
excellent work and in a very real sense, the most practical and helpful
work that is being done with the arriving immigrant. The same need
also is apparent here as elsewhere that the work should be organized
in such way as to bring it into vital touch with the immigrant work
in various Ports of Entry, and in close relation with the missionary
work in our towns and cities.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>The Methodist Episcopal Church maintains a Deaconess Home at
611 Vine Street. Miss Ford of the Methodist Church, and Miss
Staake of the Lutheran Church, and Mr. Levins of the Philadelphia
Bible Society, have been engaged in the missionary service at the
Philadelphia Port for many years.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia Bible Society distributed 50,479 books printed
in fifty different languages.</p>

<p>The Women's Christian Temperance Union, through the work of
Miss M. L. Grunninger, during the year met ninety vessels and distributed
nearly 40,000 pages of literature.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia Baptist City Mission Society carried on their
port missionary work through the services of their city missionaries.</p>

<p>Mr. Levins, missionary of the Philadelphia Bible Society, related
the following incident:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"I wish I could picture to you the dying of an immigrant at the
Immigrant Station. On one side knelt the Matron, and on the other
side Miss Ford, a Methodist deaconess, and before him an interpreter
reading from a Testament in his own language. The Matron held her
hands in the attitude of prayer, the dying man smiled and nodded his
head yes, indicating that he understood her and would pray. This
was the last comfort the dying stranger received&mdash;a Jew reading our
Master's Words to him and the prayers of two Christian women."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>At a Conference of the workers and of the missionaries and others
interested in the work at Philadelphia, it was voted that as soon as
practicable the Committee of Six should consider a definite plan for
organizing the missionary work at the Philadelphia Port. There was
a great desire for unity and efficiency in this service. There was
unanimous agreement that it would be wise, if possible, to organize
the work at this time so as to be definitely prepared for effective
service, and to meet whatever conditions may arise in the immigration
problem in the near future. This Conference also approved the
proposition to appoint in each port city a Local Advisory Committee
through which the missionary work could be supervised.</p>

<p>The greatest decrease last year (June 30, 1915) was in non-skilled
or miscellaneous workers.</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p2t">Emigration Statistics</p>

<p>Emigration for a period of years is about one-third. From
1908&ndash;1910 inclusive: 81 per cent. had been in America not over five
years; 14.7 not over ten years.</p>

<p>Of those coming to this country from 1890&ndash;1900 only 70 per cent.
were found here at the end of that period.</p>

<p>In 1899&ndash;1909 there were more than 8,000,000 immigrants admitted.
Of this number 1,013,974 were under fourteen years of age,
and 6,786,506 were between 14&ndash;44, and 412,554 were over forty-five.</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p2t">Present Responsibility for Future Opportunity</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> problem of restricting immigration that for many years
has been puzzling the politicians, reformers and various
civic and philanthropic and religious societies and national
organizations, has been settled for the time, at least, by the
European War.</p>

<p>The danger is that the Christian Church shall regard this
breathing spell as a time for the relaxation of energy. Such an
attitude is wholly contrary to the real meaning of this hour and
does not at all respond to its earnest offer of a splendid opportunity
for effective service and permanent achievement. It is the
very best time we have had for several years to get together, to
study conditions, to canvass fields, to discover needs, and develop
methods of work.</p>

<p>It has been demonstrated that the scope of this work can be
enlarged, and its effectiveness increased by organizing its activities,
so that this branch of our missionary service shall represent
the Christian love and life operating with a spirit wholly interdenominational
and non-sectarian through a body of workers,
inspired by the same motive, working by a common method, and
moving toward a well-defined goal. Thus our Ports of Entry
missionary service would be appreciated at its true value, and be
recognized by Government authorities and other organizations as
a most important and efficient factor, and be given the place it
deserves in cooperation with the federal, civic, educational and
philanthropic agencies, working in any comprehensive service for
welcoming and protecting the Immigrant.</p>

<p>For the full consummation of this scheme, there must be clear
vision of the far-reaching scope of the Immigrant work and adequate
realization of the vast opportunity and unlimited possibilities
for achievement in this service. There must be a deep sense of responsibility
and keen appreciation of the price to be paid in order to
realize the fulfilment of the vision. There must be a willingness
to let go not a few denominational and perhaps personal preferences,
and a readiness to sacrifice some things that have been held
quite dear.</p>

<p>It is the hour of a great responsibility devolving upon the
Christian Church to discharge her obligation to create such a spirit
of genuine fellowship between Americans "New" and "Old" that
there shall be established throughout our land a Christian brotherhood
that knows "neither border, nor breed, nor birth," even the
gracious and masterful "Brotherhood of the Sons of God."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
